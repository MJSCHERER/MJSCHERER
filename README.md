## 🧠 Leadership Philosophy

> *Strong systems come from clear thinking, disciplined execution, and empowered people.*

I value **clarity over complexity**, **outcomes over activity**, and **culture as a force multiplier**.
Technology is never just about tools — it’s about decisions, trade-offs, and the humans who maintain them.

At CastleLabs, I help shape not only **what** we build, but **how** we build — and **why it matters**.

## 🧠 A Note on Problem-Solving

Some bugs are fixed with more code.
Others disappear when you slow down, observe the system, and understand its timing, incentives, and failure modes.

Good engineering is often less about heroics — and more about seeing the whole machine.
