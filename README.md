> “Think like Einstein, lead like Brain — and execute like Pinky on caffeine.”

I’m driven by **clarity**, **strategic velocity**, and a strong sense of **engineering culture**.
At **CastleLabs**, I help shape not only **what** we build — but **how** and **why** we build it.

## 🌀 Bonus Debug Fact

I once solved a race condition faster by pretending to be **Pinky** asking **Brain** what the plan was.
Another time, I cracked a persistent async bug by mapping it like a **time loop** — because sometimes the key isn’t more code, it’s better observation.
